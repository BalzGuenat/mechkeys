CAD files for sandwich style case- these are all on a ponoko P2 (384mm x 384mm) template. Holes are 2.2mm for use with M2 screws.

You'll need one of each:

### Plate/Bottom

All plates support Alps and Cherry switches, the only differences are the stabilizers. If you're planning an alps board, double check everything, there isn't much standardization.

Plates should be 1.5mm, it will be strong enough for daily use, but exercise care seating keycaps and support the PCB from behind.

* `P2_LFK78_Alps.dxf` Cherry/costar stabilizer for spacebar, Matias/Alps on the rest.
* `P2_LFK78_CherryStab.dxf` Cherry/costar stabilizers. 
* `P2_LFK78_CostarStab.dxf` Costar stabilizers.


### Spacer
* `p2_spacer_3mm.dxf` 3 layers meant to be used with 3mm stock.
* `P2_spacer_4-5mm.dxf` 2 layers for 4.5 or 5.6mm stock.
* `P2_spacer_3mm_hex.dxf` 3 layers, center layer has cut out for a captive hex nut (untested).
