CAD files for sandwich style case- these are all on a ponoko P2 (384mm x 384mm) template. Holes are 2.2mm for use with M2 screws.

You'll need one of each:

### Plate/Bottom

All plates support Alps and Cherry switches, the only differences are the stabilizers. If you're planning an alps board, double check everything, there isn't much standardization.

* `P2_LFK78_Alps.dxf` Cherry/costar stabilizer for spacebar, Matias/Alps on the rest.
* `P2_LFK78_CherryStab.dxf` Cherry/costar stabilizers. 
* `P2_LFK78_CostarStab.dxf` Cherry stabilizers.


### Spacer
* `p2_spacer_3mm.dxf` 3 layers meant to be used with 3mm stock.
* `P2_spacer_4-5mm.dxf` 2 layers for 4.5 or 5.6mm stock.
* `P2_spacer_3mm_hex.dxf` 3 layers, center layer has cut out for a captive hex nut (untested).
